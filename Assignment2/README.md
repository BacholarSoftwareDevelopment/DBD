- Flexible
  - Shemaless: 
     - You don't have to design a schema beforehand; therefore you don't have to be 100% sure what you want to store beforehand. 
     - And sin ce you don't have to adhere to a special schema, you can at any moment change or fill in data.
- Distributed
- Fault tolerant
  - 100% uptime through replication



### 2. What is the CAP theorem?

**Consistency:** Every read receives the most recent write or an error.
     - *"it either works.. or it doesn't"

**Availability:** Every request receives a (non-error) response
     - 

**Partition:** tolerant


          - 
CAP Applies to distributed systems 

ACID addresses an individual node's data consistency
CAP addresses cluster-wide data consistency

#### 3. What are ideal use cases of HBase?
